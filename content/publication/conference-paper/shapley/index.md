abstract: The true population-level importance of a variable in a prediction task provides useful knowledge about the underlying data-generating mechanism and can help in deciding which measurements to collect in subsequent experiments. Valid statistical inference on this importance is a key component in understanding the population of interest. We present a computationally efficient procedure for estimating and obtaining valid statistical inference on the Shapley Population Variable Importance Measure (SPVIM).
summary: You choose a variable importance measure and a prediction algorithm; we produce point estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values using a computationally efficient algorithm.

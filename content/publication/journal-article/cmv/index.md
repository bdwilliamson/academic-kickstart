We used machine learning and classical statistical tools to assess potential surrogate endpoings for cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and identified several viral load kinetic variables (mean, peak, and change in viral load over the first five weeks of treatment) that satisfied the Prentice criteria for surrogate endpoints.

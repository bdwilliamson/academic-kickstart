It is often of interest to understand the population interplay between
the outcome and measured covariates. Variable importance is a useful
tool towards this goal. Examples include: HIV vaccine studies,
correlates of risk analyses, and identifying patients at high risk of
returning to a hospital after discharge for heart failure. This is joint
work with [Marco
Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html), [Peter
Gilbert](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/gilbert-peter.html), [Noah Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/), and [Jean Feng](https://www.jeanfeng.com/).

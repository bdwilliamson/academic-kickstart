In this work, we propose a statistical method for combining inexpensive
(but often lower-quality) estimates of relative abundance (e.g.,
collected using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene) and higher
quality (but often expensive) estimates of absolute abundance (e.g.,
from quantitative PCR) to estimate absolute abundance of all taxa.
Crucially, our proposal accounts for differences in the efficiency of
taxon detection in the relative and absolute abundance data. This is
joint work with [Jim Hughes](http://faculty.washington.edu/jphughes/)
and [Amy Willis](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/team/amy-willis).

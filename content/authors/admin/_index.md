I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Vaccine and Infectious Disease
Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division.html)
at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), where I work with
[Ying
Huang](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/huang-ying.html).

I completed my doctoral studies in
[Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the [University
of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) under the guidance of [Marco
Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Noah
Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/).

I am interested in problems of high-dimensional data, data science, and statistical inference. In particular, I enjoy working on developing new methodology for addressing scientific questions using large and complex datasets, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in the resulting estimates. I also enjoy working on problems involving how best to tell a story using data. I have been primarily motivated by applications in public health and medicine, but I am always open to collaborations on interesting problems in any area of research.

I am also a member of the Hutch United Outreach Committee, and am committed to increasing equity, diversity, and inclusion in (bio)statistics and science more broadly.
